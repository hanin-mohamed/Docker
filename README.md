## What is Docker? üê≥
Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a **container**. This solves the classic problem of "It works on my machine but not on the server!" by ensuring that applications run consistently across different environments.

### Why Use Docker? ü§î
Before Docker, developers faced issues like:
- Different environments: An app works on one system but fails on another due to dependency conflicts.
- Manual setup: Installing software dependencies manually on every machine was time-consuming.
- Resource inefficiency: Running multiple applications on a server often led to conflicts and resource management issues.

Docker solves these issues by containerizing applications, ensuring they run the same way everywhere!

##  Docker Concepts 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Image 
A **Docker Image** is a lightweight, standalone package that contains everything needed to run an application (code, runtime, libraries, dependencies...). It acts as a **blueprint** for creating containers.

#### Commands:
```sh
docker pull imageName          # Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull imageName:version  # Pull a specific version of an image
docker images                  # List all downloaded images
docker rmi image_id            # Remove an image(only if no container is using it)
```
mportant Note: If an image is being used by a container, you must remove the container first before deleting the image.
```
docker rm container_id  # Remove the container
docker rmi image_id     # Now remove the image
---

```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Container 
A **Container** is a running instance of a Docker Image. Containers are isolated environments that run applications.

#### Commands:
```sh
docker run imageName                    # Create and start a container
docker run -d imageName                 # Run container in detached mode (background)
docker run --name containerName imageName # Assign a name to the container
docker ps                                # List running containers
docker ps -a                             # List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker stop container_id                 # Stop a running container
docker start container_id                 # Start a stopped container
docker rm container_id                   # Remove a container (must be stopped first)
```

üîπ Example:
```sh
docker run --name haneen-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
```
Creates a PostgreSQL container with the name `haneen-postgres`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Logs 
Docker allows you to check container logs for debugging purposes.

#### Commands:
```sh
docker logs container_name        # View logs
docker logs -f container_name     # View logs in real-time (follow mode)
```
Follow Mode (-f): Keeps the logs updating in real-time, similar to watching a live feed of updates on a webpage.
---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Docker Exec - Running Commands Inside Containers 
You may need to execute commands inside a running container.

#### Commands:
```sh
docker exec -it container_name bash   # Open a terminal inside the container
docker exec -it container_name database_client -U username -p # Connect to database inside a container
```

üîπ Example:
```sh
docker exec -it postgres-sql-anonymous psql -U postgres
```

## Docker Volumes  - Solving Data Persistence Issues
### Problem:
By default, when a container is deleted, all its data is lost. This is a major issue for databases or any application that needs persistent data.
### Solution: **Docker Volumes**
A **Volume** is a way to persist data outside of a container, ensuring data is not lost when a container is removed or restarted.

### Types of Volumes:
1. **Named Volumes** ‚Äì Managed by Docker, stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
2. **Anonymous Volumes** ‚Äì Created when you don't specify a name
3. **Bind Mounts** ‚Äì Maps a host directory to a container directory

#### Commands:
```sh
docker volume create volume_name  # Create a volume
docker volume ls                  # List volumes
docker run --name postgres-sql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v volume_name:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
```
üîπ Example:
```sh
docker run --name postgres-sql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v /users/HANEEN/docker/volumes/postgres/data:/var/lib/postgres/data postgres
```
This command ensures PostgreSQL database data is stored on your local machine and persists even if the container is deleted.
